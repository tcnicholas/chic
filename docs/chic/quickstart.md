# Quick start

You've got your MOF CIF and are ready to coarse-grain it; let's go!

The quickest route in is to check out the [examples](examples/basics.md) pages.
The examples are written with explanations and expected usage. If you are not
interested in my ramblings, the full code from the example is given at the
bottom of each example page for ease of copy-and-pasting for your own examples.

Each example script is also given in the `chic` source distribution.
